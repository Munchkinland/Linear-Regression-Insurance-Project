Linear Regression Implementation

Overview
This project focuses on implementing a linear regression model to predict the cost of a person's health insurance based on various physiological factors. The dataset used for training and evaluation contains information about clients, including age, gender, body mass index (bmi), number of children, smoking status, residential region, and health insurance premium (charges).

Implementation Steps
Data Exploration and Cleaning:

Explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
Check for missing or inconsistent data and handle accordingly.
Data Preprocessing:

Encode categorical variables, such as gender and smoking status.
Normalize or scale numerical features if necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution of variables.
Visualize relationships between features and the target variable (charges).
Feature Selection:

Use feature selection techniques to identify the most relevant features for the model.
Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a linear regression model using the training data.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) on the training data and Coefficient of Determination (R^2) on the test data.
Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional):

Explore hyperparameter tuning, for example, using GridSearchCV, to optimize the model's performance.
Prediction:

Make predictions on new data to estimate health insurance premiums.
Instructions:
To predict the cost of a person's health insurance:

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Follow the implementation steps outlined above.
Run the provided Jupyter notebook or Python script for the linear regression implementation.
Analyze the model's performance metrics, including MSE and R^2.
Use the trained model to predict health insurance premiums for new data.
Dataset:
The dataset includes the following variables:

age: Age of the primary beneficiary (numeric)
sex: Gender of the primary beneficiary (categorical)
bmi: Body mass index (numeric)
children: Number of children/dependents covered by health insurance (numeric)
smoker: Smoking status (categorical)
region: Beneficiary's residential area in the USA (categorical)
charges: Health insurance premium (numeric)
